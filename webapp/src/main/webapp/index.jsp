<h1>Welcome to My Instance of the Simple DevOps Project!!!</h1>
<h2>I am working on building a complete pipeline using Jenkins.</h2>
<p>So far, I have been able to integrate Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Tomcat to deploy this artifact into a docker container. </p>

<b>I look forward to getting to the Kubernetes part, so that I can have redundancy and fault tolerance on my applications.</b>
